# 0x0C. Unity - AR Slingshot Game
Project to create a “slingshot” game in which the application will detect a horizontal plane (like the floor or a table) and generate moving targets on top of the plane. The user can then launch projectiles to hit the targets for points, creating interaction between a screen and the user’s physical space.

This project will utilize Unity’s AR Foundation 3.0.1 and Unity 2019 LTS.
